    <h3>Q1. Give a write-up on the Difference between copy by value and copy by reference. </h3>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Copy by value</th>
            <th scope="col">Copy by reference</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Whenever an element is assigned to another the value of the element is copied to another. for example <br> let a =10;<br>let b=a //10 is copied to b</td>
            <td>Whenever an element is assigned to another the address of assigning element is copied to another. for example <br> let a =[1,2,3,4];<br>let b=a //address of a is copied to b</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>Any changes in the element to which the assignment was done is not reflected in to the element from which the data was assigned. for example <br> let a =10;<br>let b=a //10 is copied to b <br>b=5br
        console.log(a,b) //a=10 , b=5  </td>  
        <td>
            since the actual address is passed any changes in the element to which value was assigned is reflected in the varible from which it was assigned. for example <br> let a =[1,2,3,4];<br>let b=a //address of a is copied to b <br>b[1]=6
            console.log(a,b)//[1,6,3,4] [1,6,3,4] 
        </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Use to assign simple data types like int float char   </td>  
         <td>
             Used to assign derived data types like array, object, json 
         </td>
           </tr>
          
        </tbody>
      </table>
    <h3>Q2. How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).</h3>
    <p>One could make use of a for in operator so to copy individual key value pairs or also can you use map function.</p>
